# Binary_Classifier_using_CNN
This is a CNN which I have fully trained from scratch , it identifies whether a photo is mine(you can train the classifier to identify any other picture as well).I have used Tensorflow for implementing the CNN . Although the training data was quite small , but the test accuracy ended up being >90%. This is a part of practice exercise.
